The expression ((A [%> B) [%> (A [%> B)) represents a layered or recursive optimation process, where variable A is first weighted against variable B using a specified percentage, and then the result of that computation is used as the new basis for a second optimation in which A is again weighted against this intermediate value. This structure reflects a reinforcement mechanism where A's influence is not only applied directly in relation to B but is subsequently reaffirmed against the outcome of the initial A-B interaction, effectively amplifying A’s relative importance in a compounded manner. This recursive approach underscores one of the core principles of optimation: it allows for dynamic, iterative refinement of relationships between variables through adjustable weighting schemes. By enabling such repeated applications, optimation provides a flexible mathematical framework for exploring how influence propagates and stabilizes in systems where variable dominance, priority, or contribution must be fine-tuned incrementally. The repeated optimation of A against a result that already includes A’s influence emphasizes A's persistent dominance, producing a compounded outcome that increasingly favors A. This method can be especially valuable in complex decision-making scenarios where the goal is not to find a single optimal solution but to understand the evolving balance between competing factors under successive layers of influence and refinement.
